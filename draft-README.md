# Expression Import Service

## Overview

The Differential Expression Import Service facilitates upload of user-provided, pre-processed differential expression datasets generated by microarray, RNA-Seq, or proteomic technologies to the user's private workspace. From there the data sets can be analyzed using annotations and analysis tools for comparison with other expression data sets in BV-BRC. Currently, BV-BRC only supports differential gene expression data in the form of log ratios, generated by comparing samples/conditions/time points.



## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).

This module provides the following application specfication(s):
* [DifferentialExpression](app_specs/DifferentialExpression.md)
